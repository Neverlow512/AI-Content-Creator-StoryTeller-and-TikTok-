Aliens were slowly taking over the world, and Vince Lee was the only one who could save humanity. Allow me to explain further. Vince, a Canadian man of modest means, earned his living through various odd jobs. He led an ordinary life until one fateful day when he began hearing a voice - the voice of his god. While I cannot say for certain what Vince's god looks like, my assumption would be this. The divine being revealed to Vince that he had been chosen for an extraordinary mission: to become the new Jesus and protect Earth from an alien invasion. These extraterrestrials were not the stereotypical little green men of science fiction films. Instead, they appeared remarkably human-like. Following his conversation with the divine entity, Vince did not seek professional mental health evaluation. Rather, he obeyed the instructions given to him by this mysterious voice.
