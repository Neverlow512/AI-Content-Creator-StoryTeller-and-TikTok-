A young girl named Lila was passionate about flying and had built a toy helicopter to practice piloting. She excitedly showed it to her mother, hoping for approval. "Look, Mom! I made this chopper and it can fly!" However, her mother scoffed at the idea. "You're a stubborn, stupid girl," she said harshly. "How many times do I have to tell you? There's no such thing as a female pilot. Focus on your cooking skills instead." "But Mom, I can still cook well too!" Lila protested. "You will never succeed in life if you don't listen to your parents," her mother said sternly. Heartbroken, Lila watched as her mom smashed the toy helicopter outside and destroyed it. One day, while cooking, Lila accidentally fried their circuit breaker, causing a blackout in the house. Her mother flew into a rage and angrily dumped Lila at her uncle's place. "You are useless! I regret giving birth to you," she yelled before driving away. Lila cried bitterly as her uncle consoled her. "Come, let's get you settled in here," he said kindly, welcoming her with open arms. Years passed and Lila worked hard at her uncle's house, secretly studying aviation books and dreaming of becoming a pilot. One day, while hanging out with her two friends, one asked casually, "So, how's your daughter doing?" "I have two sons," the mother snapped angrily. "Ask me about them!" Suddenly, her friend pointed to the TV news. "Look, it's your daughter! She just landed her first plane as the youngest female pilot and companies are lining up for her." "Yes, that's my daughter," the mother said proudly. The reporter turned to Lila and asked, "To whom would you like to dedicate this achievement?" Lila smiled brightly and replied, "I dedicate this day to my uncle. He alone believed in me. And a shoutout to my mom too - she never believed I could do it, but I did it, Mom!" Her mother burst into tears as she watched her daughter's interview on TV. "Oh, my darling," she sobbed. "If only I had believed in you sooner..."
