A young girl excitedly ran to her mother, holding up a homemade helicopter. "Look, Mom! I made this chopper, and it can fly!" The mother took the helicopter outside and smashed it to pieces. "You're a stubborn and stupid girl," she scolded. "How many times do I need to tell you? There's no such thing as a female pilot. Focus on developing your cooking skills instead."

She never believed I could make it, but here I am, Mom. I did it." Overwhelmed with emotion, the mother wept. "Oh, my darling daughter," she whispered to herself. "If only I had believed in you..."
