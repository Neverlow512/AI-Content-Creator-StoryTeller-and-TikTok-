 So aliens are slowly taking over the world and this man is the only one who can save us. Let me explain. Now the man's name is Vince Lee. He's Canadian. He works odd jobs here and there to pay his bills. He's a normal guy. And then one day, Vince starts hearing a voice and it's the voice of his god. And I don't know what his god looks like, but I assume he looks like this. So his god tells him, Vince Lee, you've been chosen for a special mission. And he basically tells him that he's the new Jesus and that aliens, extraterrestrials, are invading Earth. And that it's now his job to protect all of humanity from this invasion. But most importantly, these aliens aren't little green men like you'd see in the movies. These aliens look like real people. Now, after Vince Lee talks to his god, he doesn't go and get evaluated by a mental health professional. No, no. Instead, he starts doing what it tells him. He starts doing what it tells him.
