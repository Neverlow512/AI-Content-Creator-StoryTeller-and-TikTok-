 A girl rushed to her mother and said, Look, mom, I made a chopper. It can fly. The mother took the chopper outside and smashed it to pieces. You're a stubborn and stupid girl. How many times will I tell you? There's nothing like a female pilot. Focus on your cooking skills. But mom, I can still cook as well. You will never succeed in life. You don't listen to your parents. The girl was heartbroken. One day, she mistakenly fried their circuit. There was blackout in the house. The mom angrily dumped her at her uncle's place. You are a useless child. I regret giving birth to you. The girl cried, but her uncle consoled and took her in. Years went by. One day, her mom was hanging out with her two friends as usual. How's your daughter doing? One asked. I have two sons. Ask me about them. She yelled angrily. Suddenly, her friend pointed at a TV news. Look, your daughter. She had just successfully landed her first plane as the youngest female pilot and companies were lining up for her. Yes, that's my daughter. My daughter. Any words? The reporter asked the girl and she said, I dedicate this day to my uncle. He alone believed in me. And shout out to my mom. She never believed in me. I did it, mom. Oh, my darling. If only I believed in you. Her mom cried.
